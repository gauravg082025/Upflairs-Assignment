🎯 Objective:
Build a Packing List App using React. Users should be able to:
- Add new items to pack
- Mark them as packed/unpacked
- Delete items from the list

📝 Requirements:

1. Initial Setup
Create a new React app using create-react-app or any preferred setup.

2. State Management
Use the following structure for managing state:
const [items, setItems] = useState([
  { id: 1, name: 'Toothbrush', isPacked: false },
]);

3. UI Features
- Input field and button to add a new item
- Render all items with:
  ✅ Item name
  ✅ Toggle packed/unpacked status
  ✅ Delete button

4. Functional Requirements
- Add new item to the list (with a unique id)
- Toggle isPacked status on click
- Delete item from the list

🧠 Hints:
Use Date.now() to generate simple unique IDs:
{ id: Date.now(), name: newItem, isPacked: false }

Use .map() to display items
Use .filter() to delete an item
Use .map() with conditionals to toggle isPacked

✨ Bonus Challenges (Optional):
- Add filter view: Show All / Packed / Unpacked
- Show summary: 3 of 5 items packed
- Allow inline editing of item name
- Save data to localStorage

✅ Example Output:
Input: Socks

Packing List:
☐ Toothbrush
☐ Socks

After clicking "Toothbrush":
✔️ ~Toothbrush~
☐ Socks

📁 Suggested File Structure (Optional):

├── App.jsx
└── PackingList.jsx  ← You build this component
