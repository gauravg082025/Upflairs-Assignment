    <h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>
    <h2>Why I Love Playing the Guitar</h2>
    <p><b>Playing the guitar</b> has always been more than just a pastime for me. It is a <i>passionate outlet</i> for my creativity, allowing me to express emotions that words can't always convey. I started playing when I was twelve, and since then, it's become a part of who I am. <br><br>
    What I enjoy most is the <u>variety of sounds</u> I can produce — from soft acoustic melodies to high-energy rock riffs. Each chord I strum tells a story, and the feeling of mastering a song is truly rewarding.</p>

    <h3>How It Helps Me Grow</h3>
    <p>Besides being fun, the guitar has taught me <b>discipline</b> and <i>patience</i>. I spend hours practicing, often repeating the same notes until they're perfect. This dedication has spilled over into other areas of my life like studies and time management.<br><br>
    In many ways, playing the guitar has been therapeutic. Whenever I'm stressed, a quiet session helps me <u>relax and focus</u>.</p>
