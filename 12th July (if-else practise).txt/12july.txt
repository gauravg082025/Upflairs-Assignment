1. Even or Odd Checker
Write a Node.js script that takes a number as input and determines whether the number is even or odd using if-else.

4. Number Range Validator
Ask the user to input a number. Use if-else to check whether the number lies within the range 10 to 20, inclusive. Display "In range" or "Out of range".

5. Check Number Equality
Take two numbers from the user. Use if-else to check if both numbers are equal or not. If they are not equal, indicate which one is larger.

6. Simple Grading System

90 and above → Grade A

75–89 → Grade B

50–74 → Grade C

Below 50 → Fail

Use nested or chained if-else statements.

8. Find the Largest of Three Numbers
Take three numbers as input. Use multiple if-else statements to find and print the largest number among them.

9. Leap Year Validator
